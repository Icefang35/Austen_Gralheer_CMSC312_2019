312 Project //TODO

At least 4 program file templates
 - use text files
 - decide the process types (arbitrary) : Text Editor, Video Processor, Internet Browser, Video Game Runner, Debugger
    - focus on each different process area (one focusing on I/O, one focusing on calculate, etc.)
 - put calculate / I/O proportions into the templates
 - put memory requirements
 **All are arbitrary, but should make sense**
